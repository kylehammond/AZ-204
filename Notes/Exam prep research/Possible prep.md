Try the Udemy course by Alan Rodrigues -https://www.udemy.com/share/101R92AEETd1dUQnoJ/ . Tip : For me the speed of 1.25 works the best. :)

You can also try the Pluralsight course - https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/developing-solutions-for-microsoft-azure-az-204 (Note: This is not updated as per the latest changes on March 26 2021).
